Voter is an app that simplifies the process of meeting up with your friends. 
It is a little bit like a combination of Doodle with Viber and a calendar. 
Users can create events and invite contacts, or groups of contacts from the contact list/ Viber/ Whatsapp and the invitees can accept, decline or offer an alternative. 
The venue of the event is the one with most votes. 
Users will be able to manage the events that they are invited to and change their response at all times.
